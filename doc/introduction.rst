About the Package
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

``kemitter`` is a Python package designed to load, process, and visualize experimental measurements collected by
wide-angle energy-momentum spectroscopy, a laboratory technique that can simultaneously resolve the energy,
momentum, and polarization distributions of light emission for simple photonic structures.
